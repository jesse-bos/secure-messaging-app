Secure messaging app

With this application, you can securely store and share messages.

After creating a message, it will be encrypted and stored in the database. You will receive a URL and password to get access to the message. The password is stored in the database in hashed form. The URL has a validity period of 30 minutes.

If you select a colleague when creating the message, an email with decryption information is sent to that person.
